**BLACKOUT** is a tense, atmospheric **2D Top-Down Survival-Horror & Stealth** prototype built on the Godot 4 engine. Players assume the role of an **Inspector** sent to investigate a sudden power failure and blackout at a remote subterranean research facility. Soon, you find yourself trapped with horrific biological threats. Armed only with a flashlight and a submachine gun, you must restore power to the console systems, manage your scarce resources, and confront the monstrous Queen spider lurking in the deepest sector.

## 🌟 Key Gameplay Systems

### 🔦 Dynamic Flashlight & Battery Management
The facility is shrouded in complete darkness. Your primary tool is a flashlight that runs on batteries. As power drains, the beam will flicker and grow dim. You must scan rooms carefully to locate spare batteries to survive the darkness.

### 🤫 Stealth & Noise-Detection AI
Enemies respond dynamically to the sounds you make and your visibility level:
- **Crouch-walking (Ctrl):** Generates zero noise, lowering your visibility but reducing movement speed.
- **Sprinting (Shift):** Allows rapid evasion but creates significant noise, instantly alerting nearby guards.
- **Combat / Gunfire:** Discharging your weapon alerts and attracts all hostiles in the sector immediately.

### 🔋 Power Generators
In order to unlock the heavy security gates and reach the exit, you must locate and interact with the **Generator Consoles** to restore power. Activating them is a loud process that draws unwanted attention.
